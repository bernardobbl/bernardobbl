# 👋 Hi, I'm Bernardo Barcellos Leite

**Software Engineer | Java & Full Stack Developer**

I am a Software Engineer with strong expertise in **Java** and **Spring Boot**, focused on building **robust, scalable, and high‑performance applications**. I have hands‑on experience with **MySQL, Hibernate, Kubernetes**, and **cloud‑based solutions**, always applying software engineering best practices.

I hold a degree in **Internet Systems** and I am currently pursuing a **Bachelor’s degree in Computer Science**, combining solid academic foundations with real‑world experience. I have also worked with **US‑based international teams**, contributing to mobile solutions designed to foster meaningful connections among users. This experience strengthened my **English fluency**, global perspective, and ability to collaborate effectively across cultures.

Beyond Java, I have experience with **JavaScript, React, mobile development, Git, AWS**, and **agile methodologies**. I value **proactivity, efficiency, collaboration, and adaptability**, and I am always motivated by new challenges and continuous growth.
